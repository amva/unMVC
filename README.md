unMVC, or A'MVC is a PHP baby framework, test project, just started, with a tendency to become something different, but encompassing all the aspects of modern needs.
- I, Arman, as a mainly C++ lover, tend to go more with the actual versions i.e. PHP 5.4, that at least give some relevant OOP design functionality.
- Other goal is, to add as much intelligence as possible, and also deploy the modern tools efficiently.

So, this particular repo is just for demonstration, discussion and test purposes here... its not even close to what its gonna become, just like in real.et
